Domain:  Security and Risk Management


Topic 1: Understand and apply concepts of confidentiality, integrity and 
availability

1. Confidentiality - "Keeping good data away from bad actors"

For Confidentiality to be maintained in a network, data must be protected at rest, in use and on the wire.

Violations of Confidentiality can come from ANYWHERE, at ANY TIME... bad decisions on the part of users, administrators and customers can all lead to a violation. Also, remember that security policies that are not implemented properly can lead to potential confidentiality violations.

Possible countermeasures include:

	a. encryption
	b. traffic padding
	c. strict access controls / authentication
	d. data classification
	e. awareness training


Confidentiality & Integrity depend on each other. One is not effective without the other.

Additional concepts linked to Confidentiality:

	1. sensitivity
	2. discretion
	3. criticality
	4. concealment
	5. isolation


2. Integrity - "Change control for data - no unauthorized modification without knowledge and consent of data owner"

Three ways in which we can understand Integrity:

	1. Preventing unauthorized subjects from making modifications
	2. Preventing authorized subjects from making unauthorized 
modifications
	3. Maintaining consistency of objects so that they are true and accurate

Possible countermeasures include:

	a. strict access controls / authentication
	b. IDS
	c. encryption
	d. hashing
	e. interface restrictions / controls
	f. input / function checks (validation)


Additional concepts linked to Integrity:

	1. accuracy
	2. authenticity
	3. validity
	4. nonrepudiation - user cannot deny having performed an action


3. Availability - authorized subjects can access objects in a timely manner without interruption

	 
Possible countermeasures include:

	a. strict access controls / authentication
	b. continuous monitoring
	c. firewalls & routers to prevent DoS / DDoS attacks
	d. redundant system design 
	e. periodic testing of backup systems


Additional concepts linked to Availability:

	1. usability
	2. accessibility
	3. timeliness

Topic 4: Understand legal and regulatory issues that pertain to information security in a global context


  1. Cyber crimes and data breaches

When assessing the effect of cybercrime, you need to evaluate areas such as:
 a. Loss of intellectual property and / or sensitive data
 b. Damage to brand image/reputation
 c. Penalties and compensatory payments
 d. Cost of countermeasures
 
 Incident - some sort of occurrence or event

 Breach - an occurrence or event that has a negative outcome

 Disclosure - making "secret" information public

 
  2. Licensing and intellectual property requirements

 Patent - A patent is a set of exclusive rights granted by a sovereign 
state or intergovernmental organization to an inventor or assignee for a limited period of time (typically 20 years) in exchange for detailed public disclosure of an invention. An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem and is a product or a process.
 
 Copyright - protects published or unpublished original work (for the duration of its author's life plus 50 years) from unauthorized duplication without due credit and compensation. Copyright covers not only books but also advertisements, articles, graphic designs, labels, letters (including emails), lyrics, maps, musical compositions, product designs, etc. 

According to the major international intellectual-property protection treaties (Berne Convention, Universal Copyright Convention, and WIPO Copyright Treaty) five rights are associated with a copyright, the right to: 

(1) Reproduce the work in any form, language, or medium 
(2) Adapt or derive more works from it 
(3) Make and distribute its copies 
(4) Perform it in public 
(5) Display or exhibit it in public  

 Trademark - a recognizable sign, design, or unique expression related to products or services of a particular source from those of others, usually called service marks.

 
  3. Import/export controls

 International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) - What is considered 
exportable
 
 Export Administration Regulations (EAR) - Under what conditions can we export

Risk: The probability (likelihood) that a given threat source will exercise a particular vulnerability and the resulting impact should that occur

Threat -  an event or situation that if it occurred, would prevent the 
organization from operating in its normal manner

Vulnerability - weakness

Likelihood - chance something might happen

Impact - what a threat will cost (quantitative/qualitative) 

Countermeasure (control) - mechanism applied to minimize risk

Residual Risk - remaining risk(s) after all countermeasures/controls have been applied

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


1. Identify threats and vulnerabilities - NIST SP800-30R1
	A vulnerability is “an inherent weakness in an information system, security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source"

	• Administrative
	• Logical (Technical)



The seven main types of control are: 
	
	1. Directive: specify acceptable rules of behavior within an organization 
	
	2. Deterrent: discourage people from violating security directives 
	
	3. Preventive: stop a security incident or information breach 
	
	4. Compensating: substitute for the loss of primary controls and mitigate risk down to an acceptable level 
	
	5. Detective: signal a warning when a security control has been breached 
	
	6. Corrective: remedy circumstance, mitigate damage, or restore controls 
	
	7. Recovery: restore conditions to normal after a security incident 


6. Security Control Assessment (SCA) - Monitor your controls to assess how well they are performing

	Tailoring - filtering
	
	Scoping - what is in & what is out
	
	Supplementation - making additions (adding on) to add value and support for mission objectives

	Types of assessments:

	a. Vulnerability
		Scanning
		Analysis
		Communicate results

	b. Penetration
		
	Strategies:

	Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) = Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) * Annual Rate Occurrence (ARO)

	       SLE * ARO = ALE
	$ 1,000.00 * 3 = $3,000


	Qualitative - measures "intangibles" | the product of likelihood and impact produces the level of risk. The higher the risk level, the more immediate the need for the organization to address the issue. (Risk Matrix)

	Process steps:

Let's go for a field trip shall we?


Risk Management Framework (RMF) Overview -

The selection and specification of security controls for a system SHOULD BE accomplished as part of an organization-wide information security program that involves the management of organizational risk. 


THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK PROVIDES A PROCESS THAT INTEGRATES SECURITY & RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES INTO THE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE.


Risk-Based Approach -

The risk-based approach to security control selection and specification considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to applicable laws, directives, Executive Orders, policies, standards, or regulations. 

The following activities related to managing organizational risk are paramount to an effective information security program and can be applied to both new and legacy systems within the context of the system development life cycle:


1. Prepare Step -

Prepare carries out essential activities at the organization, mission and business process, and information system levels of the enterprise to help prepare the organization to manage its security and privacy risks using the Risk Management Framework.


2. Categorize Step -

Categorize the system and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by that system based on an impact analysis (*1).


3. Select Step -

Select an initial set of baseline security controls for the system based on the security categorization; tailoring and supplementing the security control baseline as needed based on organization assessment of risk and local conditions.


4. Implement Step -

Implement the security controls and document how the controls are deployed within the system and environment of operation.


5. Assess Step -

Assess the security controls using appropriate procedures to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.


6. Authorize Step -

Authorize system operation based upon a determination of the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations and the Nation resulting from the operation of the system and the decision that this risk is acceptable (*2).


7. Monitor Step -

Monitor and assess selected security controls in the system on an ongoing basis including assessing security control effectiveness, documenting changes to the system or environment of operation, conducting security impact analyses of the associated changes, and reporting the security state of the system to appropriate organizational officials (*3).


Footnotes:

1. The RMF categorize step, including consideration of legislation, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and organizational mission/business/operational requirements, facilitates the identification of security requirements.

2. NIST Special Publication 800-37 Revision 2 provides guidance on authorizing system to operate.

3. NIST Special Publication 800-37 Revision 2 provides guidance on monitoring the security controls in the environment of operation, the ongoing risk determination and acceptance, and the approved system authorization to operated status.

Topic 10:  Understand and apply threat modeling concepts and methodologies

What is Threat Modeling? - a process by which potential threats, such as structural vulnerabilities can be identified, enumerated, and prioritized – all from a hypothetical attacker’s point of view. 

The purpose of threat modeling is to provide defenders with a systematic analysis of the probable attacker’s profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker.

The threat risk modeling process has five steps: 
	1. Identify Security Objectives
	2. Survey the Application / system
	3. Decompose it
	4. Identify Threats
	5. Identify Vulnerabilities


1. Threat modeling methodologies - History

1977 - Christopher Alexander's Architectural Patterns

1988 - Robert Barnard develops 1st profile of an attacker

1994 - Edward Amoroso enumerates the concept of a “threat tree” in his book, “Fundamentals of Computer Security Technology” to graphically represent how a potential threat to an IT system can be exploited

1998 - Bruce Schneier's analysis of cyber risks utilizing attack trees in his paper entitled “Toward a Secure System Engineering Methodology” 

1999 - Loren Kohnfelder & Praerit Gard develop the STRIDE threat model 	(Spoofing identity, Tampering with data, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege)

2003 - OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability 	Evaluation)

2004 - Frank Swiderski and Window Snyder wrote “Threat Modeling,” & 		developed the concept of using threat models to create secure 		applications

2014 - Ryan Stillions expressed the idea that cyber threats should be 		expressed with different semantic levels, and proposed the DML (Detection Maturity Level) model


What are the most well known models:

STRIDE Methodology - characterizing known threats according to the kinds of exploit that are used (or motivation of the attacker).

DREAD Methodology - quantifying, comparing and prioritizing the amount of risk presented by each evaluated threat. The DREAD algorithm, shown below, is used to compute a risk value, which is an average of all five categories.

Risk_DREAD = (DAMAGE + REPRODUCIBILITY + EXPLOITABILITY + AFFECTED USERS + DISCOVERABILITY) / 5 

The calculation always produces a number between 0 and 10; the higher the number, the more serious the risk. 

P.A.S.T.A. - Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA). A seven-step process for aligning business objectives and technical requirements, taking into account compliance issues and business analysis. Provides a dynamic threat identification, enumeration, and scoring process. Once the threat model is completed security subject matter experts develop a detailed analysis of the identified threats. Finally, appropriate security controls can be enumerated. Provides an attacker-centric view of the application and infrastructure from which defenders can develop an asset-centric mitigation strategy.

Trike - Threat models are used to satisfy the security auditing process. Threat models are based on a “requirements model.” The requirements model establishes the stakeholder-defined “acceptable” level of risk assigned to each asset class. Analysis of the requirements model yields a threat model form which threats are enumerated and assigned risk values. The completed threat model is used to construct a risk model based on asset, roles, actions, and calculated risk exposure.

VAST - Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat modeling. Focuses on the necessity of scaling the threat modeling process across the infrastructure and entire SDLC, and integrating it seamlessly into an Agile software development methodology. The methodology seeks to provide actionable outputs for the unique needs of various stakeholders: application architects and developers, cybersecurity personnel, and senior executives.

AS/NZS 4360:2004 Risk Management - the world’s first formal standard for documenting and managing risk.

The five steps of the AS/NZS 4360 process are: 

1. Establish Context: Establish the risk domain, i.e., which assets/systems are important?

2. Identify the Risks: Within the risk domain, what specific risks are apparent?

3. Analyze the Risks: Look at the risks and determine if there are any supporting controls in place.

4. Evaluate the Risks: Determine the residual risk.

5. Treat the Risks: Describe the method to treat the risks so that risks selected by the business will be mitigated.

Note: AS/NZS 4360 assumes that risk will be managed by an operational risk group, and that the organization has adequate skills and risk management resources in house to identify, analyze, and treat the risks. 

CVSS - The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) established the NIAC Vulnerability Disclosure Working Group, which incorporates input from Cisco Systems, Symantec, ISS, Qualys, Microsoft, CERT/CC, and eBay.

Topic 11:  Apply risk-based management concepts to the supply chain

1. Risks associated with hardware, software, and services
	
NIST SP800-161 - Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and Organizations (page 7)

Supply chain risks include insertion of counterfeits, unauthorized 
production, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software and hardware (e.g., GPS tracking devices, computer chips, etc.), as well as poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. These risks are realized when threats in the supply chain exploit existing 
vulnerabilities.
 
2. Third-party assessment and monitoring

	SLA's vs. Assurance via Due Diligence
 
3. Minimum security requirements

	Requirements gathering

4. Service-level requirements

	SLA vs SLR

=========================================================================

Topic 12:  Establish and maintain a security awareness, education, and 
training program

Security awareness: 

Establishing an understanding of the importance of, and need to, comply with security policies within the organization

Addresses the "WHY" of policy



1. Methods and techniques to present awareness and training 

2. Periodic content reviews 

3. Program effectiveness evaluation


========================================================================

Other Stuff of Note:

Organizational Roles and Responsibilities:

Security Role - the part an individual plays in the security architecture of the organization


Roles to know ...

Data Owner - responsible for data classification

Data Custodian - responsible for implementing the protections called out by the security policy at the behest/direction of the data owner. Performs all activities necessary to provide CIA protection.

User - any person who has access to a secured system



Risk terminology and concepts - Know the vocab !!!

Asset - anything within the organization that has value and should be afforded CIA protections

Asset valuation - dollar value assigned to an asset

Threats - a potential occurrence that may cause an undesirable outcome vis-a-vis an asset

Vulnerability - weakness to be exploited

Exposure - degree to which you are susceptible to asset loss due to a threat

Risk - possibility or likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability to cause harm to an asset

	risk = threat * vulnerability


Threat agent | actor | event - the bad thing looking to do harm

Safeguard | control | countermeasure - something deployed or used to mitigate risk

Attack - the exploitation of a vulnerability by a threat agent (bad actor)

Breach - a countermeasure being bypassed or rendered ineffective


Quantitative Risk Analysis: ALE = SLE * ARO

	1. Exposure Factor (EF) - % of loss experienced IF a specific asset were attacked

	2. Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) - the cost associated with a single realized risk against a single asset

	3. Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO) - frequency @ which a specified risk will be realized over a single year

	4. Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) - potential yearly cost of  all instances of a specified threat

	5. Asset Value (AV) - $$$ amount asset is worth to the organization
  

	     $10.00   $1.00    10
		ALE = SLE  *  ARO

$1.00 * 10 ($10.00)    =  $ 1.00    *   10 TIMES (FIREWALL FAILURE)



	1. Countermeasure is less than ALE  Do this
	2. Countermeasure is equal to ALE   Do this
	3. Countermeasure is greater than ALE  Think before acting
